				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p id="intro">
					Hello, I’m Nicholas Meade, but everyone calls me Nick. I am 31 years old, and I hail from Cork, Ireland.</br></br> 
					Before coming to HZ in Middelburg I spent the last 5 years working in the IT company 
					<a href="https://www.xanadu.ie/" target="_blank">Xanadu Consultancy Ltd.</a>, who are both the 
					service provider and operator for the online gambling exchange Matchbook. While 
					the role was a Client Support position for Matchbook, where I assisted users with account queries, 
					issues, and troubleshooting, I was able to connect with members of the various IT teams in the company. 
					</br></br> 
					It was thanks to this I was able to pick up skills that, while not directly involved in coding, 
					networking, or the likes, it allowed for me to better understand how the systems operated and develop 
					a more troubleshooting, and analytical-focused mindset that let me look at issues and interactions from 
					a different perspective and come up with an efficient resolution where possible.

				<h3>A bit about Cork</h3>
					<p>
						Cork, or Corcaigh in Irish, is the largest county situated in the southernmost part of Ireland.
						<img class="cork-map" src="resources/images/cork-map.jpg" alt="Cork Map">				
						Although Dublin may be official capital of Ireland, the proud people of Cork (jokingly) believe that Cork is in fact the <em>Real Capital</em>, calling it <em>The People's Republic of Cork</em>.
						</br></br>
					</p>
					<p>
						We are also known for our sarcasm and strange phrases such as saying <em>"I will yeah"</em> when asked to do something, which, depending on the tone of voice, means "No" or "Not a chance".
					</p>
					</br>
					<p>
						While I could go on about all the great things about the city and county, I'll limit myself to only a few:
						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://gotireland.com/2012/04/22/the-shandon-tower-cork-citys-famous-four-faced-liar/" target="_blank">Shandon Bell Tower, aka The Four Faced Liar</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/en-IE/visit-us/jameson-distillery-midleton" target="_blank">The Jameson Distillery Midleton</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://www.visitcobh.com/" target="_blank">The Port Town of Cobh</a></li>					
						</ul>
					</p>
				</br>

				<h3>Hobbies & Activities</h3>
				<p>
					Many of my hobbies would be common passive hobbies, like with many others, which let me kick back and unwind. These include:
					<ul>
						<li>Reading</li>
						<li>Watching TV &#38 Movies, mostly Animations, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, or even Gordon Ramsay creatively shouting at chefs in MasterChef &#38 Hell's Kitchen.</li>
						<li>Playing Video Games</li>
						<li>Listening to Music</li>
					</ul>
					</br></br>
					However, my more active hobbies also include: 
					<img class="lvo-display" src="resources/images/lvo-display.jpg" alt="LVO Player Display">
					<ul>
						<li>Wandering, think walking but you pick a random direction and go! You only are in trouble when you enter somewhere where you're not supposed to be in, or you can't remember your way back...</li>
						<li>Collecting, building and playing Warhammer, a miniature tabletop game played globally.</li>
					</ul>
					</br>
					The image to the right is from when I travelled to the world's largest Warhammer 40,000 event in Las Vegas, Nevada, in January 2020 for my birthday. The owner of this army and display is an award-winning painter who also won best display at that year's event.
					</br></br>
					This event in particular had slightly over 1000 players, but there was an overall attendance of at least 3500 people for the many events held over 4 days.

				Finally, for anyone who would like to experience the mixed bag that are the genres of music I listen too, I've made a Spotify playlist for you to browse below.
