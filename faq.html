							<h3>How can you print your documents at HZ?</h3>
							<p>
							</br>
								You can connect to a printer in HZ in 1 of 2 ways.
							</br></br>
								The first is to have your laptop scan the local Wi-Fi 
								network for available devices and you should see a 
								printer listed, connect to that 
								printer and select it when printing your documents.
							</br></br>
								The second is to go to <a href="https://print.hz.nl/" target="_blank"> print.hz.nl</a> 
								and log in with your HZ logins (not your HZ email, only the details 
								before the &#64; symbol)
							</br></br>
								Once logged in, upload your file and select the printer you want
								to print your document to, you can also select "Advanced" to open the
								advanced printer settings.
							</br></br>
								Finally, go to the printer on your floor (next to the coffee machines)
								and scan your student card against the terminal and select "Print", follow the 
								steps on screen to print your document.
							</br></br>
								Just remember, you will need to have funds on your student card as you will before
								charged per page. The price varies on the print-type but will be listed on the terminal before
								you confirm the print request.

							<h3>What do I need to do to park my car at HZ?</h3>
							<p>
								Unfortunately it is not possible directly at the HZ building in Middelburg 
								(excluding 2 disabled parking spaces next to the building), 
								however there is free parking available at the PZEM building's car park across the way, 
								at Poelendaelesingel 10. This is only about a 5 - 10 minutes walk from campus.
							</p>
							</br>
							<p>
								Please note that the tunnel connecting PEZM to HZ is currently blocked due to the 
								ongoing construction of the Joint Research Center Zeeland. 
								However, there is a pedestrian crossing a few meters away at the intersection.
