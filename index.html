					<p>Welcome, or as we say in Ireland fáilte, to my portfolio website. </p> </br>
					<p>From a young age I was fortunate to encounter various forms of technology and try my 
					hand at multiple coding languages. But over the last 5 years I was able to work for an 
					IT company who are both the service provider and operator for online gambling website, 
					among other ventures.</p></br>
					<p>While the role was a Client Support position, assisting users with account issues, 
					queries and troubleshooting on said website, I was able to connect with members of the 
					various IT teams within the company. It was thanks to this I was able to pick up skills that, 
					while not directly involved in coding, networking, or the likes, it allowed for me to better 
					understand how the systems operated and develop a more troubleshooting, and 
					analytical-focused mindset that let me look at issues and interactions from a different 
					perspective and come up with an efficient resolution where possible.</p></br>
					<p>Before the madness that was the year 2020, I was applying for a <a href="https://corkcollegeofcommerce.ie/data-analytics/">Data Analysis</a> course, 
					as I was developing an interest in that area and felt that the experience would have been 
					a great. Unfortunately, that course never went ahead but I was offered a place in their <a href="https://corkcollegeofcommerce.ie/software-development-level-5/"> 
					Software Development</a> course in its stead. It was thanks to this course that I believed I 
					could progress further with a career in this industry, and it is also the reason I 
					discovered <a href="https://hz.nl/en/study-programmes/it">HZ University of Applied Science’s ICT course</a>. As one of my assignments we were 
					tasked with discovering progressions opportunities and I made the decision to look outside 
					of my country’s education system and look at overseas opportunities.</p></br>
					<p>HZ’s ICT course offered opportunities for me to study both Software Engineering and 
					Data Science, as well as develop Business IT skills through the course’s content and 
					assignments. Add this to their focus on hands on, practical learning, compared to a more 
					theoretical approach, I believed that this type of course suited my learning styles as well 
					as provide plenty of opportunities to learn new skills and develop upon my existing skillset. 
					With my mind set on taking this course, I took the leap by leaving my job, packing my bags and 
					moving from my home, in the valley of Cork City, Ireland to the beautiful flatlands 
					of Middelburg, The Netherlands.</p></br>
					<p>This website will act as a portfolio of the work I will complete during my studies 
					in the coming years showing the following
